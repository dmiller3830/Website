<H1>  Template for Future Websites </H1> 

So I'm an independent artist who makes a lot of digital art and webcomics. I'm also getting into 3d printing as well as things like 3d and animation. I have a lot of hobbies and interests so for my capstone I wanted
to build something like a basic template that I could use to build any kind of website that I might need so I would no longer be dependent on 3rd party platforms like Patreon, Gumroad or Instagram. 
The focus of my front end was to build a basic online store with user view and admin view that offers the admin Update, Create and Delete features so items can be easily added to the store and edited. Even though the 
focus is on an online store the structure is there to add a gallery, a blog, webtoons and more.

When you first come to the page you'll be greeted with a login page. I have two dummy profiles set up, one for a user and one for an Admin. When you login with the right credentials you'll be redirected to the Welcome page. For this template I named my website the Obscura Den. 
![Welcome Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a5fa1de-8911-4bdc-80c5-17a5c19127cd)
![Admin View Products Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d224aa6-93bb-4f97-8a20-4e44a69122d0)

Then when you click on the link for the Store you'll be redirected to a products page. As this is the Admin view you have the option to add products to the products page. If you click on a specific product you'll be redirected to the details page of that specific product.

Because we have an admin signed in the admin has the ability to edit the product by changing the price as well as other details like type. The admin also has the option to delete the product. 

![User View Product Details](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7d1e21a-987d-4a8a-a1f6-83b8a8a48c26)

These CRUD features are only available to the admin but regular users or customers have their own views that only display the product and the price and does not offer the ability to edit or add or delete products.
