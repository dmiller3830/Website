<H1>  Template for Future Websites </H1> 

So I'm an independent artist who makes a lot of digital art and webcomics. I'm also getting into 3d printing as well as things like 3d and animation. I have a lot of hobbies and interests so for my capstone I wanted
to build something like a basic template that I could use to build any kind of website that I might need so I would no longer be dependent on 3rd party platforms like Patreon, Gumroad or Instagram. 
The focus of my front end was to build a basic online store with user view and admin view that offers the admin Update, Create and Delete features so items can be easily added to the store and edited. Even though the 
focus is on an online store the structure is there to add a gallery, a blog, webtoons and more.
